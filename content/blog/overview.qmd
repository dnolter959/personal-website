Writing is important to me, for reasons that are well summarized [here](https://paulgraham.com/words.html) and [here](https://jsomers.net/blog/more-people-should-write). In general, I think writing demands (and so, fosters) clear and rigorous thinking, and is an important avenue of creative expression. I use this blog to work through topics in statistics and comment on topics I find interesting.
