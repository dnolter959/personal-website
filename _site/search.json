    "text": "If I could utter one sentence to the 16 year-old version of myself, it would be something like this: do not be afraid to construct your identify forcefully and with declaractive statements.\nAnyone who has worked with a statistically-oriented person knows we resist providing simple answers or making definitive predictions or guidance. This is because statisticians are in the business of seeking truth using data, and the truth is complicated.\nI do not think of the world or my life in terms of simple cause-and-effect relationships but in terms of probability distributions, uncertainty, and unknowable counterfactuals; I recognize the role of randomness in all things, including my life and sense of self.\nI used to spend time pondering, really, the random circumstances dictating my own life. I grew up in a particular time and place, was exposed to a particular set of people. They influenced me when I was impressionable, and these experiences created a path-dependent cascade of thoughts, experiences that constitute what I do and who I am.\nThis can be helpful when making decisions and thinking strategically in the presence of uncertainty, but a bit of self-delusion about the nature of things\nI understand that the initial conditions of my life, for which I had no say, have played a very large role in dictating my opportunities and experiences, and will continue to do so going forward.",

    "text": "This is a selection of analytical projects I have completed either individually or as part of a small team.\n\n1. An R package for multiple imputation on longitudinal data\nIt turns out people don’t like completing surveys, especially longitudinal ones. What are you supposed to do with the half-data you are left with at the end? This R package implements a statistical method proposed by Moreno-Betancur and Chavance in their 2013 paper, which facilitates sensitivity analyses of Mixed Model results to various departures from the Missing at Random (MAR) assumption, in the presence of drop-out.\n\n\n2. A Python package for automatic differentiation\nHave you ever wanted to take a derivative, but with a computer? This Python package performs automatic differentiation of scalar or vector functions with scalar or vector inputs. The package can perform “forward” or “reverse” mode automatic differentiation.\n\n\n3. A Python data analysis on food access programs\nSome people do not have access to food they need to live healthy lives. The purpose of this analysis was to use publically available data sources to identify US counties which would be good targets for a government program to address poor food accesss. I sought to identify communities that would be well served by such a program, and also estimate the health impact of these programs.\n\n\n4. Understanding regularization in the presence of sparsity.\nRegularization is used within the context of linear regression to balance bias and variance and avoid overfitting. This paper details the results of a simulation study to investigate the performance of LASSO, Ridge, and Elastic Net approaches on model performance under a variety of conditions (e.g., high sparsity).",
