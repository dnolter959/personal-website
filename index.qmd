Welcome! Here's a bit about me, professionally and otherwise:

- I have training math and economics (University of Rochester, BA) and biostatistics (Harvard, MS). 
- I have 6+ years of work experience in economic consulting, data science, and medical research. 
- I love solving problems with data, and communicating results through writing. 
- Work is important to me! I hope to have a positive impact through the work that I do.
- I love running, reading, writing, and listening to podcasts.
- [These](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4s8txG9rCi09HGedNuhcvM?si=118a8d3d8bee4a4d) are a few of my favorite things.
